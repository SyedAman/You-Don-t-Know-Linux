Linux is a very complicated system. for example, when a web server makes a connection to a database server. It uses a shared library files with other programs.
However, the interaction is between the shared library programs is often NOT a concern of the daily user.
Software developers and system admins have been making sure that such interactions is made minimal to the ordinary users so that they can get their tasks done (for example, a creative artist just wants their program like Photoshop to render the image the way they want rather than how the computer makes the calcuation of the render.)

The method of hiding the details of processes with a system is called abstraction.
Because of ABSTRACTION, daily users can their specific tasks done without have to worry about the inner workings of the system.
Abstractions hides many of the system features such as: subsystem, module and package.
Right now, I will call them COMPONENT to avoid confusion.
